# Hangman-game
This is a word guessing game.
STEPS TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PERL PROGRAM FILE :

1.Change the directory of the terminal to the directory where the .pl files are present.
2.Now type "perl Hangman.pl" in the terminal and press enter.

HOW TO PLAY GAME:

1. THIS GAME IS CASE SENSITIVE. You must type all the characters in small letters.
2. After pressing enter, it will display a hanging setup with 0 body parts.
3. The words will be displayed in with the hyphens. Example, the word, "good" will be displayed as "----" at the beginning.
4. The correct letters will be over written on the hyphes.
   (All the hyphens which the guessing word is equal to, will be replaced. Example, on guessing 'o', '-oo-', both 'o' will be replaced. No need to guess 'o' again.)
5. You only have 6 chances.
6. If you entered a character, which you have already entered, then it will warn you saying," you have already entered this letter".
   And you have to guess again.
7. The game will be finished if you exeeds the guessing limit, that is 6. Or if you are able to guess the word correctly before the guessing limit.
8. Atlast it will ask you if you would like to play again or not.
9. You should press 'y' to continue and 'n' to quit.
10. This 'y' and 'n' is also case sensitive.
11. Apart from this if you enter anything else, it will ask you to enter again, saying, you entered an invalid option.
12. Try to avoid guessing same letters.
